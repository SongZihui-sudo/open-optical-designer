# Open Optical Designer

This is an early work-in-progress web application for
designing optical lenses consisting of sequential lens elements.
It is intended to eventually support practical design of, for
example, a large aperture double gauss lens for a full frame camera with
effective control of image aberrations.

## Features

* Generalized aspherical conic surfaces
* Refractive ray tracing calculated in 3D
* Incoming ray environment control
* Automatic 2D cross section viewport
* Material database
* Focal length and f-number calculation
* Import designs from ".len" files

## Planned Functionality

* Material browser
* Define surface properties in terms of a formula
* Save/load designs as local files
* Optimization
* Chromatic aberration graph
* Point spread function simulation
* Modulation transfer function graph
* Distortion grid simulation
* Through-the-lens test chart rendering simulation
* Lens element model export for computer-controlled manufacturing
* Mirrors, reflections, and total transmission (including complex refractive indices and Fresnel equations)
* Numerical aperture
* Design generators/wizards (singlet, achromatic doublet, telescope objective, spherical best form lens, etc.)
* Example designs (achromatic doublet, double gauss, expired camera lens patents, etc.)
